Before you run our project, download all necessary files (a compressed one)from google drive.
Extract it and past them under webapp/static/models
Then you need find an old file called filename_to_casename.pkl in our old project and past it to the same directory(webapp/static/models).
After all, our project can be run by running run.py.

All libraries we used so far are listed in testing/env.txt
