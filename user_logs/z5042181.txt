Week 1
Formed Aquarius Group
Team selected Project 1
Went through the Flask tutorial and built a MVP
Wrote the Project Proposal Report Introduction Section

Week 2
Researched Local Sensitivity Hashing (LSH)
Researched succint summarization
Completed Fast Query section of Project Proposal Report

Week 3
Researched LSH libraries
Candidates:
    1. LSH Falconn library
    2. sklearn

Week 4
Implemented LSH Falconn library
Implemented euclidean distance measure

Week 5
Integration:
    1. Worked with Daniel to get integration between doc2vec and LSH algorithm functioning
    2. Worked with Sheng to get LSH algorithm working with webapp

Week 6
Integration issues between doc2vec and LSH.  Removed some non essential normalization features from LSH.

Week 7
Continue to have integration issues between doc2vec and LSH.
Produced test files to compare query vector to matrix vectors.

Week 8
Working with Daniel to get deterministic vectors out of doc2vec.
Continue to compare query vectors to matrix vectors.

Week 9
Finished work with deterministic vectors for doc2vec.
Testing search engine for correctness.


Week 10
Fine tuning LSH parameters.  Produced correct results.

Tested all 30k files.  Results:

Rank   No.
0    29571
1      102
2        9
3        1

Teamed deemed that this results were satisfactory.

Week 11
Clean up and doc code.
Produced documented code as sample for rest of team.
